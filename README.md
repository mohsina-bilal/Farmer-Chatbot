Data has been **pre-processed and normalized** to ensure consistency across languages. Hindi translations were generated using a **hybrid approach**, combining automated machine translation with manual cleaning for accuracy.

## Purpose
This dataset is released to:
1. Provide a **bilingual resource** (Englishâ€“Hindi) for research in **low-resource NLP**, machine translation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).  
2. Support **chatbot development** for farmers in India, enabling access to agricultural government schemes in regional languages.  
3. Serve as **supplementary information** to the associated research paper submission.
